why we use master and slave architecture

In your enivronment you have mutilple devlopment teams on daily basies they will do code changes and commits due to the new commits it will triggers the CI process.if we have 100's of CI process running by this Jenkins will be overloaded and also some teams might have different requierments some projects need java 7 and some 8. some need python 2 and some need python 3

to avoid all the issue we go for master and slave architecture.

1. Master will work as a scheduler.
2. slave/ worker node will process for CI.

you can also update which team should which node and which application need to go for which worker node.
